    "**数据处理阶段**：\n",
    "对输入的图像分割成许多小的图像块（patches）。\n",
    "随机选择一部分图像块（通常是 75% 的图像块）进行遮掩（mask），即从输入中移除这些块。\n",
    "剩下未遮掩的图像块被送入编码器（encoder）进行特征提取。\n",
    "\n",
    "**掩码令牌** (Mask Tokens)：\n",
    "在编码器之后，将掩码块的位置用特殊的“掩码令牌”来补充。掩码令牌是用于填充被遮掩的图像块位置的特殊标记。因为解码器需要完整的图像块序列（包含未遮掩的块和遮掩的块）来重建原始图像，所以掩码令牌在遮掩块的位置上起到了占位的作用。通过解码器（decoder）对编码后的图像块和掩码令牌进行处理，尝试重建原始图像的像素。\n",
    "\n",
    "简单说，掩码令牌使解码器能够区分哪些部分是已知信息（编码器提供的未遮掩块），哪些是需要预测的未知信息（由掩码块的位置指示）。这有效地帮助解码器在训练过程中专注于重建被遮掩的部分。\n",
    "\n",
    "**使用阶段**：\n",
    "预训练完成后，解码器被丢弃，只有编码器被保留。\n",
    "对于后续任务（如图像分类或目标识别），编码器接收完整的未遮掩图像块作为输入。\n",
    "这种方法的核心思想是通过预测被遮掩的部分来让模型学习更好的图像表示。预训练阶段类似于自监督学习，通过对遮掩部分的重建来提升编码器的特征提取能力。\n",

Then, the story itself was a weak copy of Lost in Translation. The Middle-Eastern setting, man with family meets new girl overseas, karaoke bar, the camera movements and the imagery - all that was a very bad imitation of the excellent Lost in Translation which had also credibility. This movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not. I wonder why Tim Robbins even considered doing this film!? The female main actress is awful - did she play the precog in Minority Report? And why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this? Lost in Translation didn't have to show excessive love scenes. R-Rated just for this? This movie isn't even worth watching it from a videostore!\", 'sentiment': 'negative'}\n",
      "Test sample[0]: {'review': 'Arguably the finest serial ever made(no argument here thus far) about Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov, and beautiful Dale Arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet. Along the way, in spellbinding, spectacular, and action-packed chapters Flash and his friends along with new found friends such as Prince Barin, Prince Thun, and the awesome King Vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless Ming of Mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter Priness Aura(now she\\'s a car!). This serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot, acting, and budget - it is miles ahead in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from The Bride of Frankenstein and the Opera House from The Phantom of the Opera just to name a few. The production values across the board are advanced, in my most humble opinion, for 1936. The costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first-rate. We get hawk-men, shark men, lion men, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids, and tigrons(oh my!)and many, many other fantastic things. Are all of them believable and first-rate special effects? No way. But for 1936 most are very impressive. The musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are well-written, lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter, and expertly scored. Director Frederick Stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for Alex Raymond\\'s phenom comic strip. Lastly, the acting is pretty good in this serial. All too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents - here most everyone has some ability. Don\\'t get me wrong, this isn\\'t a Shakespeare troupe by any means, but Buster Crabbe does a workmanlike, likable job as Flash. He is ably aided by Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson, and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out. But before I get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted, it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the Hayes Office. I see more flesh on Flash and on Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than in movies decades later. The shorts Crabbe(and unfortunately for all of us Professor Zarkov((Frank Shannon)) wears are about as form-fitting a pair of shorts guys can wear. The girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful Jean Rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell. Lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful. But for me the two actors that make the serial are Charles Middleton as Ming: officious, sardonic, merciless, and fun. Middleton is a class act. Jack \"Tiny\" Lipson plays King Vultan: boisterous, rousing, hilarious - a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism. Lipson steals each and every scene he is in. The plot meanders here, there, and everywhere - but Flash Gordon is the penultimate serial, space opera, and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow. Excellent!', 'sentiment': 'positive'}\n"
